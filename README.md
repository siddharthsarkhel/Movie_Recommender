#Project Title: Movie Recommender System using TMDB Dataset

Description:
In this project, I developed a Movie Recommender System utilizing The Movie Database (TMDB) dataset. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly application that recommends movies to users based on their preferences and the similarity between movies.

Key Steps:

Data Collection: I obtained movie data from TMDB, including information such as movie titles, genres, and user ratings. This dataset served as the foundation for the recommendation engine.

Vectorization: I employed techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Word Embeddings (Word2Vec) to transform textual movie descriptions and user reviews into numerical vectors. This allowed for quantitative analysis of movie content.

Cosine Similarity: To calculate the similarity between movies, I used cosine distance as a measure. Cosine similarity helps identify how closely related two movies are based on their vectorized content.

Web Application: I created an interactive web application using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications with minimal code. Users could input their movie preferences or choose from predefined categories. 

Recommendation Engine: Behind the scenes, the application used the calculated cosine distances to suggest movies that were most similar to the user's input or selections.

Hosting: The completed project was hosted on a web server and made accessible to users via the link: https://movierecommendersys.streamlit.app/.

#Outcome:
The Movie Recommender System provided users with personalized movie recommendations, enhancing their movie-watching experience. It demonstrated the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, vectorization, and cosine similarity in building an effective recommendation engine.
